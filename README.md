#### Brief Description of Project - All assets that are required for manufacturing activities in the project are generally identified as inventory and they are issued by the store of the factory. It is the operation of the “ROYAL COSMETICS company”. Manufacturers work to assemble components and materials into a finished product. Distributors place bulk orders with the manufacturer and then sell far smaller quantities to either retail stores or end-users. The production process often requires a thermal or chemical conversion,such as with heat, time, or pressure. As a result, a product created through process manufacturing cannot be disassembled into its constituent parts. Different reports that will be produced to monitor the process by the top management of the company
